* Channels!
  Support components with a second part of the name where it have a sequence number.
  For example, support commands like ":MEASure:CHANnel1:VOLTage?"
  Now they cannot be set (partially because numbers are forbbiden) because the shorted name of two channels will collide:
    ":MEASure:CHANnel1:VOLTage?" -> ":MEAS:CHAN:VOLT?"
    ":MEASure:CHANnel2:VOLTage?" -> ":MEAS:CHAN:VOLT?"
  When they have to be:
    ":MEASure:CHANnel1:VOLTage?" -> ":MEAS:CHAN1:VOLT?"
    ":MEASure:CHANnel2:VOLTage?" -> ":MEAS:CHAN2:VOLT?"
